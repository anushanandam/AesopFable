There was once a little Kid who thought he 
 was strong because of his growing horns. 
 While the Kid was eating , his flock disappears
 and a wolf appears causing the Kid to bargain 
 for his life. The Kid performs for the wolf as the
 wolf pipes a tune and they dance. The Shepherds
 Dog hears the piping and jumps on top of the Wolf to 
 attack him; the moral is to not let anything turn you
 from your purpose.
